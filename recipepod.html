            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Cooking should be fun!  What’s no fun at all?  Shuffling through bookmarks, websites, emails, and papers trying to search for that one recipe that you want to make.  Enter RecipePod – a mobile application that allows users to store and organize all of their recipes in a single location.</p>
            <div class="twocolumn">
              <div>
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>Online recipes are my jam, I rely on them heavily to guide me as I’m cooking.  Strangely, saving the recipes isn’t something I do.  I don’t want a huge list of bookmarks or print-outs.  After some talks with friends and family, it turns out that recipe storage is a common pain point among people who cook at home.  This is the problem RecipePod aims to solve.</p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Home cooks want a centralized location for their recipes.  RecipePod is the solution.  It provides a quick and easy way to upload recipes or import them from various online sources, as well as share them with others.</p>

            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            <p>The survey revealed exactly what RecipePod’s users need and confirmed the original hypothesis of home cooks not having a proper tool to organize their recipes.  Of my survey respondents, an overwhelming majority of users (80%+) utilize recipes and are very interested in a tool that would allow them to save them in a single location.  Furthermore, the survey revealed that their current methods of saving recipes are scattered amongst digital and physical mediums.</p>

                <p>85% of respondents cook at least a few times per month and generally enjoy it.  A majority (80%) of these home cooks use some form of recipes – a very good sign for my potential product centered on recipe storage!</p>

            <p>I took a look at the competition to determine the direction of the product.  The analysis consisted of two big name cloud storage players, Google Drive and DropBox, and a recipe app, AnyList.  The most compelling features about Google Drive and DropBox in relation to the concept of RecipePod are the ease of use across multiple devices and the simple, intuitive interfaces of the products.  On the other hand, AnyList packs in all the features (and more) that RecipePod needs but does so in a clunky way – the visual design is clearly lacking and everything seems to take one tap too many.  With that said, the direction of RecipePod was clear.  Combine the functionality of AnyList with the ease of use and clean design sense of Google Drive and DropBox.</p>

            <p>The goal of user research was to really hone in on the target market.  Conducting a user survey and creating user personas was key to identifying RecipePod’s users.  So, who are they and what are they looking for?  RecipePod’s target market is home cooks who cook at least a few times a week and enjoy it.  That is obviously a very broad user base, however, my survey respondents were mostly students and working professionals in their late 20s to mid 30s – thus, I chose to narrow my target audience to this segment because they are proficient with mobile products and may have more experience cooking with online recipes.  Based on that analysis, my user personas were born.</p>

            <p>Let’s check back in with the core problem: storage and organization of recipes in a centralized location.  User research confirmed the core problem, and user stories define exactly what tasks the product needs to include.  There are 6 tasks that must be included in the MVP to address the core problem: creating an account, inputting recipes, importing online recipes, editing recipes, deleting recipes, and sharing recipes.</p>

            <p>Our user stories lead right into our user flows, the backbone of our wireframes.  My user flows were able to define the roadmap of my MVP and point out a few admissions within the processes.  My initial sketches and flows were very basic.  I received some client feedback to watch out for edge cases (wrong credentials, failed search, more sharing platforms, etc.).  This helped expand the skeleton of the product in order to be well prepared going into wireframing.</p>

            <p>A definite evolution of the product emerged from wireframing.  After my first iteration of wires and client feedback, there was a realization that there were two separate processes for adding a recipe – inputting a recipe and importing a recipe.  While they are somewhat intertwined, they need to be wireframed separately in order for a user to step through a prototype properly.  That said, once the client was able to click through my LoFi prototype, more issues arose.  Most importantly, the user wasn’t able to navigate back to the dashboard or the edit screens.  Adding in the ability to navigate home within the navbar was a crucial addition that wasn’t very noticeable before the wireframing and clickable prototyping phase.</p>
            <p><b>ONBOARDING:</b> Comments on the layout of items on the screens (buttons, logos, tagines, etc.) led to alternate designs to increase the transparency of the onboarding process.</p>
            <p><img class="onboard" src="../img/onboarding.png" alt="onboard"></p>
            <p><b>ADD RECIPE:</b> Users had slight hesitation when engaging the add recipe function.  The initial tap into the add recipe process needed to be very clear.  Iconography revisions were necessary to streamline the flow.</p>

Cooking at home can often be seen as an obligation or chore rather than fun and engaging.  Our target users are occasional at home cooks so emojis and illustrative elements will bring some playfulness to the kitchen.</p>

            <p>The brand typefaces were chosen to echo the playful and whimsical nature of the RecipePod logo.  Dosis is a rounded sans serif fonts that appears approachable – a more squared font would appear too rigid to echo the fun vibe of the brand.  It’s also a very modern font, which reinforces the clean, modern, and organizational purpose of the product.  Furthermore, the friendly and curvy font Lato pairs nicely with the brand typeface to bolster the readability and cleanliness of RecipePod.  Both fonts have many weights to allow for multiple uses such as headers and body text, which is critical for a recipe app that relies on lengthy instructions and lists for its users.</p>

            <p>There was a noticeable evolution in the product when incorporating the branding and visual style.  Client feedback was invaluable in being able to identify certain elements that were cluttering the design, such as unnecessary bullet points and redundant icons.  Amongst iterations, user feedback through preference testing was very helpful in making decisions on color combinations, tagline layouts, and button styles.  As I entered the next round of usability testing, I was confident the visual styling was pretty close to where it needed to be.</p>
            <p><b>STARKNESS:</b> Users commented on overall starkness within the design.  The solution seemed to be more imagery or design elements to limit the amount of whitespace, while keeping the minimal aesthetic.  Along the same lines, more pictures in the recipe lists helped draw users’ eyes and assist them in choosing a recipe.</p>

            <p><b>NAVBAR SIMPLIFICATION:</b> Flickering eyes and twitchy fingers led me to believe that some simplification could help.  By absorbing the share option into the options menu, the navbar would now take on a cleaner and simpler look to not distract users’ attention.</p>

            <p>There are plenty of recipe apps out there, and I would say that was the biggest concern.  How do we differentiate from the other ones?  Well, I think the game changer is the ability to import recipes from the web, and AnyList may be the only competitor that has that feature.  So how did we improve upon AnyList?  A clean, playful aesthetic and simple, intuitive flows refined by iterations of visual design and user testing take RecipePod’s user experience above and beyond!</p>
